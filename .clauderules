# Website Mocks Project Rules

## Navigation
- Main catalog: `mock-design-overview.md` - start here for all mockup browsing
- Design folders contain complete implementations (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Memory bank in `memory-bank/` for project documentation

## Framework Requirements
- Open source only (MIT/Apache/GPL licenses)
- No corporate/business aesthetics
- Creative, indie, experimental approaches preferred
- Static implementation (no build tools required)

## File Organization
- Keep design-mock-details.md for technical specs
- Include proper framework attribution
- Maintain consistent naming patterns
- All mockups focus on MCP website content

## Development Priorities
1. Visual creativity over corporate polish
2. Framework diversity and experimentation  
3. Open source compliance and attribution
4. Functional demonstrations of each aesthetic

## Key Insight
This project showcases alternatives to traditional business website design through creative CSS framework exploration.
