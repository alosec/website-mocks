# Active Context - Website Mocks

## Current Focus
Building creative, non-corporate website design mockups based on open source CSS frameworks.

## Navigation Directive
**Parent Site Navigator**: Use `/home/alex/code/website-mocks/mock-design-overview.md` as the main catalog to browse all available design mockups. Each entry links to individual design folders with complete implementations.

## Completed Work
- **4 functional mockups**: sakura-zen, flow-state, persona, cyberpunk-neon (partial)
- **30 design directories** created and organized
- **Main catalog** with framework attributions and design descriptions
- **Migration complete** from memory-mcp/mocks to dedicated website-mocks project

## Current State
- Directory structure: `/home/alex/code/website-mocks/`
- Working mockups ready for demonstration
- 26 additional design systems cataloged but not yet implemented
- All based on MIT/Apache/GPL licensed open source frameworks

## Next Actions
- Complete remaining mockups as requested
- Focus on non-corporate, creative aesthetics
- Maintain open source compliance and attribution

## Key Files
- `mock-design-overview.md` - Main catalog and navigation
- `memory-bank/` - Project documentation
- Individual design folders with `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
