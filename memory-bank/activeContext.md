# Active Context - Website Mocks

## Current Focus
Implementing the remaining 26 website design mockups from our comprehensive catalog of 30 non-corporate design systems.

## Navigation System - COMPLETED âœ…
**Parent Site Navigator**: `/home/alex/code/website-mocks/index.html` - Minimal HTML navigator with sakura.css styling
- Visual status indicators: âœ… Complete | ðŸš§ In Progress | ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Direct links to `index.html` files in each mockup directory
- Organized by 6 design categories with framework attributions
- Clean, accessible interface for browsing all design systems

## Completed Work
- **âœ… Navigator Implementation**: Sakura.css styled parent site with direct mockup links
- **âœ… Git Repository**: Initial commit with conventional format, 17 files committed
- **âœ… 3 Functional Mockups**: sakura-zen, flow-state, persona (complete implementations)
- **âœ… 1 Partial Mock**: cyberpunk-neon (design details only, needs implementation)
- **âœ… Documentation Structure**: Memory bank and catalog system established

## Current State - Ready for Mock Implementation
- **Navigator**: `/home/alex/code/website-mocks/index.html` fully functional
- **Catalog**: `mock-design-overview.md` contains all 30 design specifications
- **Directory Structure**: 30 design folders created with placeholders
- **Implementation Pipeline**: Ready to build remaining 26 mockups systematically

## Next Phase: Mock Implementation
**Priority Order for Implementation:**
1. **High Priority** (Complete partial): Cyberpunk Neon (finish implementation)
2. **Minimal & Classless** (4 remaining): Water Flow, MVP Brutalist, New Wave, Pico Micro
3. **Experimental & Creative** (5 remaining): Magick Portal, Marx Revolution, Clay Morph, UnoCSS Atomic, Holiday Festive
4. **Retro & Nostalgic** (5 remaining): Windows 98 Terminal, XP Luna, NES 8-Bit, Terminal Hacker, LaTeX Academic
5. **Artistic & Expressive** (5 remaining): Ridge Landscape, Concrete Industrial, Tacit Silent, Chota Tiny, Primitive Ancient
6. **Performance & Utility** (4 remaining): Milligram Lightweight, Skeleton Bones, Twind Dynamic, WindiCSS Speed
7. **Experimental Concepts** (5 remaining): Glassmorphism Blur, Neumorphism Soft, Bauhaus Geometric, Memphis Design, Vaporwave Aesthetic

## Implementation Strategy
- Focus on one mockup at a time for quality over speed
- Research each framework's authentic implementation approach
- Maintain MCP content consistency across all designs
- Test each mockup for responsiveness and accessibility
- Update navigator status indicators as mockups are completed

## Key Files
- **Navigator**: `index.html` - Main entry point with sakura.css styling
- **Catalog**: `mock-design-overview.md` - Complete design specifications
- **Memory Bank**: `memory-bank/` - Project documentation and context
- **Mockup Pattern**: `design-name/{index.html, style.css, script.js, design-mock-details.md}`
